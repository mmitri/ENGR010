Spy Door Final Project
Write Up

The components I used for this project are two buttons for the 
secret entrance and a button to close the door. I used an LED and
a speaker to indicate the intruder/wrong code input. I used a servo
to simulate a door and a potentiometer for my component 5. I used three methods,
approach(), leave(), printInfo(), and powerOut(). Approach() handles the password input
as well as wrong inputs and collects the data as to which person enterded. Leave()
closes the door once a button is pressed and clears the screen. PrintInfo() prints
the info related to component 4 after the number of entries is a factor of 10. powerOut()
is my component 5, which is a random power outage and requires the door to be physically closed
via a potentiometer. The function chooses a random number and if it is 2 certain values,
it prints out that there is a power outage and waits until the potentiometer is above 512 to then
close the door and continue as normal. The most challenging part of this project
was the complexity of the events happening in sequence, however, having global variables that
change when a specific event happened made it a much smoother process. The most exciting part
was when my project all came together. Thanks for a great ENGR 010 class and for the effort
and determination put into this course after the disease outbreak. I know it was hard for all of us
and I appreciate it.
